Description: 
    The CoDaImpact package implements additional tools for interpreting the results of CoDa regression models (for more details see Dargel and Thomas-Agnan (2024) \doi{10.1016/j.csda.2024.107945}).
    The new interpretation tools comprise variation scenarios, elasticities, elasticity differences and share ratio elasticities.
    These tools are independent of log-ratio transformations and allow an interpretation in the original space of shares.
    CoDaImpact is designed to be used with the compositions package and its ecosystem.

#' Rice yiled data  in the Vietnamese provinces
#'
#' @description
#' The data is presented in  Trinh et al. (2023) for studying the impact
#' of climate change on  rice production in Vietnam. \cr
#' It contains the following information:
#'   +  `PROVINCE`: a factor for the 63 provinces of Vietnam
#'   +  `REGION`: a factor with the 6 main regions
#'   +  `YEAR`: a numeric corresponding to the year
#'   +  `YIELD`: a numeric for the rice production in tons per hectare
#'   +  `PRECIPITATION`: a numeric for the annual precipitation in liters
#'   +  `TEMPERATURES`: a compositional variable represented as a matrix \cr
#'       whose columns correspond to the proportion of days in a year where the maximal
#'       temperature (in Celsius degrees) falls into one of the three categories:
#'       "LOW" ([-6,25.1]), "MIDDLE" ([25.1,35.4])  and "HIGH" ([35.4,45]).

#' Results of french departmental elections in 2015
#'
#' The data is used by Nguyen et. al (2020) and originally disseminated by the
#' French ministry (Ministère de l'Intérieur et des Outre-Mer).
#' Information about the population characteristics comes from the french
#' national statistics institute (INSEE).
#'
#' @details
#'
#'   + `left`, `right`, `extreme_right`: Vote shares during the election grouped into three blocks
#'   + `Age_1839`, `Age_4064`, `Age_65plus`: Share of the population falling into one of three age categories
#'   + `Educ_BeforeHighschool`, `Educ_Highschool`, `Educ_Higher`: Share of the population having completed a certain level of education.
#'   + `asset_owner_rate`: The proportion of people who own assets
#'   + `income_taxpayer_rate`: The proportion of people who pay income tax
#'   + `forgeigner_rate`: The proportion of foreigners

#' French car market data
#'
#' This data set shows monthly data of the French car market between 2003 and 2015.
#' The market is divided into 5 main segments (A to E), according to the size of the vehicle chassis.
#' Morais et. al (2018) first used this data to compare compositional and Dirichlet models for market shares.
#'
#' @details
#'   + `SEG_`: Corresponds to the shares of sales in each of the five market
#'     segments A,B,C,D and E. Where A are the smallest cars and E the largest.
#'     The segmentation is explained in [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_classification).
#'   + `GDP`: GDP figures in millions at current prices
#'   + `HOUSEHOLD_EXPENDITURE`: total household expenditure in millions at previous years prices
#'   + `GAS_PRICE`: Corresponds to the gas price including VAT.
#'   + `SCRAPPING_SUBSIDY`: A dummy indicating periods where the French government provided subsidies for scrapping a car.
#'
#' @source
#'   + The figures for GDP and household expenditure are originally provided by the The National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE).
#'   + The gas prices are from the OECD.
#'   + The market share of each segment of come from a simulation by Renault.
